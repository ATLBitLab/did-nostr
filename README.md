# Why?
I have no idea whether this will work, or if it's a good idea. What has me interested is:
* Could provide a means for key rotation while using the same pubkey as identity
* Could allow for interop between different protocols / systems
* Could enable use of Verifiable Credentials
  * e.g. CashApp could issue cashtag Verifiable Credentials to DIDs.  This would basically allow people to have a "blue checkmark" or, more generally speaking, some trusted way to say "this pubkey is linked to this cashtag".
  * e.g. could introduce stuff like payments on nostr via CashApp simply by having a pubkey present their cashtag VC to a CashApp api endpoint. VC can be used as a form of authentication, since the VC was issued by CashApp
* Could allow for less reliance on DNS if desired

# Brain Dump

## DIDs
DIDs, like URLs are fully qualified URIs. Similar to a URL, DIDs can be resolved. resolving a URL like `https://snort.social/` returns html. So what does resolving a DID return? A DID document

## DID Documents
What is a DID document? it's a JSON object that contains information about the DID e.g. 
* how to contact this DID, 
* pubkeys this DID uses to sign messages, 
* asymmetric encryption keys that can be used to create shared keys and encrypt messages _for_ the DID. Example:

```json

so what do the properties in the DID document mean?
| property             | description                                                                                      | notes                                                                                                                        |

>üí° there are several other properties that can exist on DID documents. more info on that [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-document-properties)

# NIP-9325
‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è

This NIP proposes the following:
* how to generate a nostr did
* a new event kind `9325` for publishing, patching, and recovering a DID.
* how to resolve a nostr DID

## DID generation
`did:nostr:<nostr_hex_pubkey>`

1. generate a new (or use an existing) nostr pubkey according to [BIP340](https://bips.xyz/340#public-key-generation) as mentioned in [nip01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips#events-and-signatures). `nostr_hex_pubkey` is represented as 32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key
2. prefix the `nostr_hex_pubkey` with `did:nostr:`

### Example
`did:nostr:41e791de6a6f6f0b3c820c2db179c0679e2c228ae6ecb9583cb48b3e1ff354b6`

>üí° [reference implementation](https://github.com/mistermoe/did-nostr/blob/main/src/did-nostr.ts#L17-L21)

>üí° if desired nostr dids can be _displayed_ using the bech32 encoded `npub` format described in [nip19](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/19.md) e.g. `did:nostr:npub1u2...`. As stated in nip19: The bech32 encodings should _not_ be used to represent a did in nostr events.

### Deriving base DID Document
the base DID document can be derived without sending a `publish` message to a relay. It's not all that useful in and of itself, but forms the foundation of DID resolution.

>üí° [reference implementation](https://github.com/tbd54566975/did-nostr/blob/main/src/did-nostr.ts#L114-L135)

>üí° TODO: write out steps to derive base DID Document by reading reference implementation

```js
// from example.ts in reference implementation
const did = pubKeyToDid(kp.public);
console.log(deriveDidDoc(did));
```

Output
```json
{
  "id": "did:nostr:41e791de6a6f6f0b3c820c2db179c0679e2c228ae6ecb9583cb48b3e1ff354b6",
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "did:nostr:41e791de6a6f6f0b3c820c2db179c0679e2c228ae6ecb9583cb48b3e1ff354b6#nip06-0",
      "type": "SchnorrSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:nostr:41e791de6a6f6f0b3c820c2db179c0679e2c228ae6ecb9583cb48b3e1ff354b6",
      "publicKeyHex": "41e791de6a6f6f0b3c820c2db179c0679e2c228ae6ecb9583cb48b3e1ff354b6"
    }
  ]
}
```

>üí° the `verificationMethod` in the example above is a schnorr pubkey. [SchnorrSecp256k1VerificationKey2019](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#SchnorrSecp256k1VerificationKey2019) is used to describe the _type_ of verification method. Honestly not entirely sure what the motiviation is behind including the year (aka `2019`).

## DID Event

<img width="1682" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4887440/220267286-f72d70ac-edb9-42f1-bf85-ef012c365ead.png">


This event can be used to publish, patch, and recover a DID. every `9325` message should contain the `o` (e.g op) and `d` (e.g. `did`) tags
```json
{
  "kind": 9325,
  "tags": [
    ["o", "publish | patch | recover"],
    ["d", "did:nostr:e2bdaa90e96a4fafb9f1c36f9b378e4bbd6fea26e5d47063e7b30aa15de37d48"]

## Resolving
>üí° [WIP reference implementation](https://github.com/mistermoe/did-nostr/blob/main/src/did-nostr.ts#L146-L224)

---

Given a DID (e.g. `did:nostr:e2bdaa90e96a4fafb9f1c36f9b378e4bbd6fea26e5d47063e7b30aa15de37d48`):
* Derive the base DID document by following [these steps](#deriving-base-did-document)
* fetch all events of kind `9325` for the DID being resolved
* order the events using `created_at`
* ensure that first event is a `publish`. perform integrity checks listed [here](#integrity-checks)
* for each event thereafter:
  * ensure that the id provided in the marked event tag matches the id of the previous event
  * if `patch`: apply patches to DID doc
  * if `recover`: perform integrity checks listed [here](#integrity-checks-1)
    * optional: include revealed pubkey as `verificationMethod` in DID doc


# Considerations
* clients or relays making use of the `#d` tag should perform necessary integrity checks before trusting that the event came from the listed DID
* if possible, relays should perform integrity checks on a `9325` event prior to storing it
